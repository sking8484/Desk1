## To - Do
Write code to export pricing data to a file, so that it can be imported by the optimizer and the export weights. Need to do this because can not have CVXOPT and mysql-python-connector in the same enviornment, which is extremely frustrating 

## Trading Platform
Ella (named after someone very special in my life who, as in this program holds control), is where everything starts. If you would like to dive into this code, start with the file Ella.py. You can dive through all the other files from there. 

### Description
The heart of this program is a quadratic programming algorithm through CVXOPT. More details here: https://cvxopt.org/examples/book/portfolio.html & https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/ This is an integrated Financial Trading platform. Currently in development stage, the end product will be a user interface where indivduals can link a robinhood trading account and have trades placed with the program.
